            VORSAG is lucky to have the following prestigious and prominent
            figures that support and bark the association. These prominent
            persons fund the association with scholarship opportunities and many
            more. Not only these prominent figures, also companies like MTN,
            Kabfam, UTV also help support oor humble association. Without these
            people, we wouldnâ€™t be where we are today.
